   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=UNTITLED (01-01:31-12)  (01-01:31-12)
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=PARIS_ ORLY - FRA IWEC Data WMO#=071490
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[3.51] degrees, Longitude difference=[5.25] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[0.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[66.55] percent, [191.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction PROJECT PARTITION of interzone surface BLOCK1:OFFICEXSWX1F_PARTITION_2_0_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction PROJECT PARTITION_REV of adjacent surface BLOCK1:OFFICEXSEX1F_PARTITION_4_0_10002
   **   ~~~   ** or the properties of the reversed layers are not correct due to differing layer front and back side values
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 9 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** Daylighting:Controls: invalid Zone or Space Name="BLOCK1:T".
   **  Fatal  ** Program terminated for above reasons, related to DAYLIGHTING
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=1
   ..... Last severe error=Daylighting:Controls: invalid Zone or Space Name="BLOCK1:T".
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.
   *************
   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).

   ************* EnergyPlus Warmup Error Summary. During Warmup: 0 Warning; 0 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Sizing Error Summary. During Sizing: 5 Warning; 1 Severe Errors.
   ************* EnergyPlus Terminated--Fatal Error Detected. 5 Warning; 1 Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  0.66sec
